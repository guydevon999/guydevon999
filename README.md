- ⚡ Fun fact: "February 30 was a day that happened in Sweden, 1712.
- This occurred because, instead of changing from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar by omitting a block of consecutive days,
- as had been done in other countries, the Swedish Empire planned to change gradually by omitting all leap days from 1700 to 1740, inclusive.
- Although the leap day was omitted in February 1700, the Great Northern War began later that year,
- diverting the attention of the Swedes from their calendar so that they did not omit leap days on the next two occasions; 1704 and 1708 remained leap years."
